Discuss the new paradigm: 1) 'Prompt Engineering as the New Fine-Tuning': How sophisticated prompting and few-shot learning can achieve results that previously required fine-tuning. 2) The rise of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) as the primary customization technique. 3) When fine-tuning is still essential (e.g., for domain-specific language or style).
